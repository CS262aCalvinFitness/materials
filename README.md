  Our goal is to create an Android application that simplifies the process of planning, executing, and sharing a workout. The need for this application is to bring those people dedicated to lifitng together by making workouts shareable across users and also to reduce paper usage of tracking workouts for athletes. The target customers are students who workout, no matter the experience level, and athletes who must workout for their respective sports. The application will allow the user to create workouts and input the number of sets, reps, and weight for each exercise of the workout. Users can do those created workouts, marking the exercises as complete during the workout. The app will store completed workouts as "Past Workouts" that the user can then go back and view, to track their progress.

  We will also add the ability to share workouts, which will help bring users of the app together. The main issue this will solve is allowing coaches to share workouts to their players in a digital form, not on paper. This would also allow players to share the workout results back with the coaches, so that the coaches can keep track of player progress. In a similar manner, this would allow users to also share completed workouts with friends, hopefully increasing social accountability when it comes to working out.
