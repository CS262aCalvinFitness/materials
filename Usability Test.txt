Usability Test: Calvin FitnessFall, 2016Mitch Stark, Ethan Clark, Matt Kotva, Russell Clousing, Mark DavisIntroduction Thank you for agreeing to do this usability test for the Calvin Fitness App. The developers would like to see first-hand what it’s like for real people to use the app, which we hope will help us improve the app. We’re testing the app, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. We want to hear exactly what you think about the app. Be honest and don’t worry about hurting our feelings. We would like to know of any ways that real users believe could improve our app.For the test, we’ll ask you to do certain tasks and we’d like you to think out loud while you’re doing them. If you have questions, just ask. If you have comments, go ahead and say them. We’ll record your comments, but won’t make them public. If, for any reason, you’d like to quit this test, then just say so. Background Questions Do you work out? If so, how often? Do you keep track of your workouts?Do you often share your workouts/results with other people?Do you have questions for me? The Test 1. Reactions to the Main Screen – Please start the app, and let us know what you think about the home screen. Is there anything that pops out at you?2. General tasks - I’ll ask you to do some of the following tasks, depending upon how much time we have together:	a)  Please find the About page, and tell me the names of the people who built the app.b) Please follow these instructions in order: * Make a new workout with the name “Test Workout”* Give this workout an exercise with the name “Bench Press”o  with 3 setso 10 repso at 50 pounds* Finally, save the workout.c)  Begin the “chest” workout. Complete 2/3 exercises, and then indicate that you have finished your workout.d) Find your completed workout under the name “Test Workout”.e) Pretend that you have a friend with this app, who goes by the username, “mjs73”. Find their workout “legs”, and save it to your device.3. Final observations – Do you have any final observations on the app? Would you consider using it? Thanks Many thanks for your willingness to help us test the new Calvin Fitness App. We really appreciate your time in helping us improve our app.
