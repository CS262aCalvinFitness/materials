Usability report for team Calvin Fitness.Our Usability test that we ran on our subjects was composed of four main tasks. The first task was to find the names of the people who created the app. This was located in the about page.  The second task was to create a new workout and add several exercises to the workout before saving the workout to the device. The third task was to start a workout and complete that workout. The fourth task was for the user to find a workout that had been shared from another user. Once the user found the shared workout the goal was to save it to the device. All users easily found the about page and the creators names. On the second task several UI improvements were suggested.  Add placeholder text to the edit weight field to clearly indicate what should be entered there. Make the difference between add to workout and save workout clearer. The third task was mostly completed without any difficulties from the users. The fourth task brought to light some issues. Mostly with making it clear that the workout had been successfully saved to the device. Also when asked if the user should share a workout to a specific other user or if a shared workout is viewable by all others the test users split about even in their responses.
